   <strong>Q1 What challenges did you encounter while creating the folder structure and linking to files and
       directories?</strong>
    <br>
    Ans. I completed this assignment within 120 minutes. When I wrote the code, I faced some issues. Initially, I made a mistake in spelling when creating the folder, which prevented me from loading the folder into my directory.
    After realizing this error, I corrected the spelling, allowing me to successfully load the folder.
    Another problem arose when linking the document with my index.html file. I mistakenly typed only one dot, preventing the file from loading in the browser.
    After carefully reviewing the code, I identified and resolved this issue.

    <strong> Q2 How did you approach troubleshooting and debugging any broken links or references?</strong>
    <br>
    Ans. Whenever I faced coding challenges, Starting by reading the code is a smart way. Understanding the existing codebase helps me to identify any issues or areas that need improvement.
 I copyied the code and pasted in Nu HTML Checker, If I faced issue or error then I
    Seeking guidance from my professorâ€™s recorded lectures is a valuable resource for me. Professors often provide insights, best practices, and explanations that can clarify concepts and address specific challenges.
    And also collaborating with friends is an effective way to learn and troubleshoot for me.

    <strong>Q3 What did you learn about the relationship between HTML and file structure in web development
        projects?</strong>
    <br>
    Ans. Understanding the relationship between HTML and file structure is essential for linking and organizing different files in web development projects.
    HTML files, like index.html, often serve as entrance points to a website and are typically located directly in the root directory rather than in sub-folders.
    On a local computer, the file structure should be logically arranged to facilitate efficient interaction between various file types, such as HTML, CSS, and media content.

    <strong>Q4 What did you find most challenging about the assignment, and how did you overcome it?</strong>
    <br>
    The most challenging part of the assignment was when I wrote the code for the document's relative path.
    I was confused because of the dot, and it was tricky for me to overcome this problem. I read the code again, and when I encountered a significant issue, I sought help from friends and the professor's recorded lecture.
